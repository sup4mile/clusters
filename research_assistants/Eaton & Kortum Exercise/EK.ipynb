    "### Question a.\n",
    "Countries are symmetric in terms of size and productivities. Trade is free (i.e., the iceberg costs of international trade between any pair of origin and destination are normalized to 1). Symmetry implies that wages are equalized across countries, provided that J is large enough and therefore that law of large numbers applies. In other words, we don't actually have to solve for the wage vector and we could instead compute the trade shares for a given vector of unit-value wages. Also, since international trade is free, the expenditure shares $\\pi$ calculated using the 'lcp' function are symmetric as well (namely, $\\pi$ is an $N \\times N$ matrix with identical elements equal to $\\tfrac{1}{N}$)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several options for solving systems of non-linear equations numerically. In this particular case, we are looking for the root of the sum of country-specific trade balances (in other words, the vector of wages such that the *global* trade balance equals zero). In other work, I have used the *JuMP.jl* package to solve systems of equations. The package has advantages and drawbacks. The advantage is that it can call a number of different solvers and it can handle a variety of optimization problems (constrained, unconstrained, linear, non-linear,...). The drawback is that the syntax has to fit the requirements of the package and it can be \"clunky\" to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, we can use the *Optim.jl* package, which is a solver with a more standard syntax (similar to solvers commonly used in *MATLAB*, for instance). Chapter 9 of the *julia.quantecon.org* website has some helpful material and references to get you started with the *Optim* package."
